Responses API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenAI’s [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)
 supports [MCP servers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp)
 as remote tool sources, allowing you to extend AI capabilities with custom functions.

The Responses API is a distinct API from OpenAI’s Completions API or Assistants API. At this time, only the Responses API supports MCP.

Currently, the Responses API only accesses **tools** from MCP servers—it queries the `list_tools` endpoint and exposes those functions to the AI agent. Other MCP features like resources and prompts are not currently supported.

### 

[​](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai#create-a-server)

Create a Server

First, create a FastMCP server with the tools you want to expose. For this example, we’ll create a server with a single tool that rolls dice.

server.py

Copy

    import random
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
        """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
        return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
    

### 

[​](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai#deploy-the-server)

Deploy the Server

Your server must be deployed to a public URL in order for OpenAI to access it. For development, you can use tools like `ngrok` to temporarily expose a locally-running server to the internet. We’ll do that for this example (you may need to install `ngrok` and create a free account), but you can use any other method to deploy your server. Assuming you saved the above code as `server.py`, you can run the following two commands in two separate terminals to deploy your server and expose it to the internet:

FastMCP server

ngrok

Copy

    python server.py
    

This exposes your unauthenticated server to the internet. Only run this command in a safe environment if you understand the risks.

### 

[​](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai#call-the-server)

Call the Server

To use the Responses API, you’ll need to install the OpenAI Python SDK (not included with FastMCP):

Copy

    pip install openai
    

You’ll also need to authenticate with OpenAI. You can do this by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Consult the OpenAI SDK documentation for more information.

Copy

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    

Here is an example of how to call your server from Python. Note that you’ll need to replace `https://your-server-url.com` with the actual URL of your server. In addition, we use `/mcp/` as the endpoint because we deployed a streamable-HTTP server with the default path; you may need to use a different endpoint if you customized your server’s deployment.

Copy

    from openai import OpenAI
    
    # Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
    url = 'https://your-server-url.com'
    
    client = OpenAI()
    
    resp = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        tools=[\
            {\
                "type": "mcp",\
                "server_label": "dice_server",\
                "server_url": f"{url}/mcp/",\
                "require_approval": "never",\
            },\
        ],
        input="Roll a few dice!",
    )
    
    print(resp.output_text)
    

If you run this code, you’ll see something like the following output:

Copy

    You rolled 3 dice and got the following results: 6, 4, and 2!
    

### 

[​](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai#authentication)

Authentication

`` New in version: `2.6.0` `` The Responses API can include headers to authenticate the request, which means you don’t have to worry about your server being publicly accessible.

####

Server Authentication

The simplest way to add authentication to the server is to use a bearer token scheme. For this example, we’ll quickly generate our own tokens with FastMCP’s `RSAKeyPair` utility, but this may not be appropriate for production use. For more details, see the complete server-side [Token Verification](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification)
 documentation. We’ll start by creating an RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens.

Copy

    from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair
    
    key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
    access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")
    

FastMCP’s `RSAKeyPair` utility is for development and testing only.

Next, we’ll create a `JWTVerifier` to authenticate the server.

Copy

    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier
    
    auth = JWTVerifier(
        public_key=key_pair.public_key,
        audience="dice-server",
    )
    
    mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)
    

Here is a complete example that you can copy/paste. For simplicity and the purposes of this example only, it will print the token to the console. **Do NOT do this in production!**

server.py

Copy

    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier
    from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair
    import random
    
    key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
    access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")
    
    auth = JWTVerifier(
        public_key=key_pair.public_key,
        audience="dice-server",
    )
    
    mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)
    
    @mcp.tool
    def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
        """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
        return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(f"\n---\n\n🔑 Dice Roller access token:\n\n{access_token}\n\n---\n")
        mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)

[​](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai#client-authentication)

Client Authentication

If you try to call the authenticated server with the same OpenAI code we wrote earlier, you’ll get an error like this:

Copy

    pythonAPIStatusError: Error code: 424 - {
        "error": {
            "message": "Error retrieving tool list from MCP server: 'dice_server'. Http status code: 401 (Unauthorized)",
            "type": "external_connector_error",
            "param": "tools",
            "code": "http_error"
        }
    }
    

As expected, the server is rejecting the request because it’s not authenticated. To authenticate the client, you can pass the token in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

Copy

    from openai import OpenAI
    
    # Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
    url = 'https://your-server-url.com'
    
    # Your access token (replace with your actual token)
    access_token = 'your-access-token'
    
    client = OpenAI()
    
    resp = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        tools=[\
            {\
                "type": "mcp",\
                "server_label": "dice_server",\
                "server_url": f"{url}/mcp/",\
                "require_approval": "never",\
                "headers": {\
                    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"\
                }\
            },\
        ],
        input="Roll a few dice!",
    )
    
    print(resp.output_text)
    

See all 27 lines

You should now see the dice roll results in the output.
