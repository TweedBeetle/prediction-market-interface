| **Token** | A token represents a stake in a specific Yes/No outcome in a Market. The price of a token can fluctuate between 0−0 - 0−1 based on the market belief in the outcome. When a market resolves, the token associated with the correct prediction can be redeemed for $1 USDC. This is also sometimes called an _Asset Id_ |
