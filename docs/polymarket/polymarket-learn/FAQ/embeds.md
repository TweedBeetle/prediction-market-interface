Substack

The embeds feature currently supports single markets only (eg “USA to Win Most Gold Medals”, not “Most Gold Medals at Paris Olympics’)

To embed a market, navigate on Polymarket.com to the single market you want to embed and click “copy link.” Navigate to your Substack editor and paste the link directly into the body of your newsletter. The editor will recognize the market and convert it to a widget that automatically refreshes with the latest odds.
