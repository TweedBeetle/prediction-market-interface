Exporting your private key gives you direct control and security over your funds. This process is applicable if you’ve signed up via email.

**DO NOT** share your private key with other parties, platforms, or people. We will never ask for your private key.

1.  Access the Export Link while signed into Polymarket: [https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket](https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket)
    
2.  Sign-in on Magic.Link
3.  Export Private Key. Once revealed, you should securely store the private key displayed, where others can’t access it.
4.  Log out of Magic.Link
