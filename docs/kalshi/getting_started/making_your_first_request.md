To make your request we recommend testing a public endpoint like [GetMarkets](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-markets)
. As you explore our other endpoints, you’ll notice some endpoints return an authentication\_error. If you want to experiment with these endpoints, you will need to get [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys)
. You may also want to sign up for a demo account to test without real funds. The following resources might help you on your journey to exploring Kalshi’s markets:

*   [**Python starter code**](https://github.com/Kalshi/kalshi-starter-code-python/tree/main)
     bare-bones API interactions with authentication examples (also see [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys)
    )
*   [**Python starter code 2**](https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/KalshiAPIStarterCodeWithApiKey.zip)
     this Python client is not maintained, but you may still find it useful as a reference for how to call certain endpoints
*   [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/kalshi)
     and check out #dev and #support
