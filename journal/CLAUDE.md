# Development Journal

This directory contains chronological records of the project's development progress, organized by date and topic.

## Purpose

The journal captures:
- Implementation phase completions
- Scope planning and design decisions
- Progress milestones and achievements
- Technical discoveries and lessons learned
- Development timelines and statistics

## Organization

Files are organized by:
1. **Subdirectory** - Project or feature area (e.g., `polymarket/`, `kalshi/`)
2. **Timestamp** - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **Type** - Nature of the entry (e.g., `phase1-completion`, `phase2-scope`)

**Example:** `polymarket/2025-11-05-phase2-completion.md`

## vs. Documentation

**Journal** (this directory):
- ✅ Chronological progress records
- ✅ Completion summaries
- ✅ Planning chronicles
- ✅ Retrospectives

**Documentation** (`docs/` directory):
- ✅ Reference guides (APIs, usage)
- ✅ Testing instructions
- ✅ Architecture documentation
- ✅ Living documents (updated over time)

## Current Entries

### Polymarket

- `2025-11-05-phase1-completion.md` - Phase 1 implementation summary (12 tools)
- `2025-11-05-phase2-scope.md` - Phase 2 planning and feature analysis
- `2025-11-05-phase2-completion.md` - Phase 2 implementation summary (7 additional tools)

## Guidelines

When adding journal entries:
1. **Always timestamp** - Use YYYY-MM-DD format
2. **Be descriptive** - Clear filename that explains content
3. **Include statistics** - Metrics, test results, code counts
4. **Document decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen
5. **Note lessons learned** - What worked, what didn't
6. **Keep snapshots** - Don't update old entries, create new ones

This creates a permanent, searchable history of the project's evolution.
